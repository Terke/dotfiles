The configuration files are almost the same with the `i3` and `polybar` configuration files of [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.info/), with some personalization.

**How to use:**
Put all the files of the i3 folder in '/home/$USER/.config/i3/'
Put all the files of the polybar folder you want in '/home/$USER/.config/polybar/' and execute 'launch.sh' to start the polybar
